Q1. Follow the procedure and report your findings for both part-1 and part-2. Show your work by summarizing in output.md 

- Try with at least three other inputs other than the given examples.
- Show testing evidence by including the inputs and respective outputs.
- Finally, summarize your findings, look for patterns and compare the performance of algorithms.

Q2. Write a program to find the convex hull for a given set of points using floating-point value with arbitrary precision [1] (with the same input and output contract as robust and non-roast convex hull algorithms in part-2).

- Suggestion: Use MP_Float in the CAGL library [2].
- Compare the time taken by the robust convex hull algorithm and the algorithm you have written using arbitrary precision float (include the inputs, respective outputs and time taken).
